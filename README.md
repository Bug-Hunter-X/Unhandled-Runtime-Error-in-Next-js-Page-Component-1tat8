This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in Next.js applications: unhandled runtime errors within page components.  The `about.js` file attempts to access the `user.name` property, which is undefined, causing a runtime error. This error is not gracefully handled by Next.js's default error boundary, leading to a broken user experience. The solution shows how to effectively handle this using error boundaries or conditional rendering.
